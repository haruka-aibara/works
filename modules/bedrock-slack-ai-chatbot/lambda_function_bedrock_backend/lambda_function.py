"""
lambda_function_bedrock_backend/lambda_function.py
This module handles processing text input through Amazon Bedrock and
sending responses back to Slack.

Conversation context comes from the Slack thread itself rather than from a store of
its own. The thread is what the user can see, so reading it is the only way the bot
can answer "what do you think?" about a discussion it was not part of — and it leaves
one source of truth instead of two that can disagree.
